## Update Your Credentials

1. Download the `credentials.json` file
2. Update the `client-ID` and `client-secret` with your own, given to you by Google when you register an OAuth 2.0 client with Google via Google API Dashboard's [credential manager]([https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)). Go to the [Getting an OAuth Token section](#Getting-an-OAuth-Token) of this readme for a walkthrough.
   1. You are required to pass an OAuth Consent Screen. (Walkthrough found [here](#OAuth-consent-screen))
3. Update the AI token
   1. Go to [replicate's website](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/python#authenticate) to create a free account (by linking your GitHub account). NOTE: you get 10 free API calls to the AI. You may wish to add a payment method. This will charge you approx $0.000021 per API call using the default settings. Feel free to set a monthly "Spend Limit" on [their billing page](https://replicate.com/account/billing). Supported models and pricing can be found on [their pricing page, in the language models section](https://replicate.com/pricing#language-models)
      1. Model Options:
         1. llama-2-13b
         2. *llama-2-70b* (**default**)
         3. llama-2-7b
         4. meta-llama-3-70b
         5. meta-llama-3-8b
         6. mistral-7b-v0.1
   2. Once you have an API token from [replicate's token section on their website](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens): copy the token and run the following in a Python-enabled terminal.
      1. `python3 update.py`
      2. `update_token`
      3. `my_API_token` (make sure to replace `my_API_token` with the token from [replicate's token section on their website](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens).
4. Update the Google Form ID
   1. Run the update script using the following code in a Python-enabled terminal. 
      1. `python3 update.py [OPTIONAL: Google_Form_URL]` (make sure to replace `[OPTIONAL: Google_Form_URL]` with the URL of your Google form **AND** *skip the 3rd step if you choose to do this*)
      2. `update_form`
      3. `Google_Form_URL` (make sure to replace `Google_Form_URL` with the URL of your Google form **ONLY IF** *you did not add the optional URL in the first step*)
         1. NOTE: you will not see an update as this will be read in as a password and will therefore be invisible.
6. Update the Google Sheets ID
   1. Run the update script using the following code in a Python-enabled terminal. 
      1. `python3 update.py [OPTIONAL: Google_Sheet_URL]` (make sure to replace `[OPTIONAL: Google_Sheet_URL]` with the URL of your Google sheet **AND** *skip the 3rd step if you choose to do this*)
      2. `update_spreadsheet`
      3. `Google_Sheet_URL` (make sure to replace `Google_Sheet_URL` with the URL of your Google sheet **ONLY IF** *you did not add the optional URL in the first step*)
         1. NOTE: you will not see an update as this will be read in as a password and will therefore be invisible.

## Getting an OAuth Token

Go to [Google Cloud Consol's](https://console.cloud.google.com/) website and select the `APIs & Services` button.

Navigate to the `credentials` tab and select the `+ CREATE CREDENTIALS` button to reveal a drop-down of 4 items. 

Select the second item (`OAuth client ID`, sub-text: "Requests user consent so your app can access the user's data")

This will bring you to the "Create OAuth client ID" page. **However**, to be able to continue you need to fill out the `OAuth consent screen` and pass the screening process. The step-by-step process is in the [OAuth consent screen](#OAuth-consent-screen) section.

Finally, click the application type dropdown, select `Desktop app`, and name it whatever you'd like.

Click the blue `CREATE` button at the bottom of the page.

A pop-up window will appear with your `client-ID` and `client-secret`. Save both somewhere secure.
