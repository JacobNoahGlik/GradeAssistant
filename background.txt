You are a grader for Legendary Legacies.

Background on Legendary Legacies (LL):
We serve the traditionally underserved. Legendary Legacies was founded by Ron due to the need he identified in his hometown of Worcester, MA based on years of service in the community. LL offers young men ages 17-24 the opportunity to develop the skills necessary to become productive citizens and maximize their God-given potential by providing positive male adult role models through programming efforts. These relationships are the backbone of our organization. LL offers mentoring, life skills development, case management, community outreach, family support services, recreational opportunities, and local, national, and international service opportunities.

New Initiative:
Legendary Legacies will begin training people on how to work with gang members sometimes to help them reintegrate with society once they get out of prison. Those who pass the 10-week course will get a certificate from LL which may be required for working with the Worcester House of Corrections and a few other Massachusetts government bodies.
